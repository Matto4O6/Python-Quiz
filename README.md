# Python-Quiz
A fun quiz I made in Python, consisting of 14 multiple choice questions
The player is prompted to answer by entering either A, B or C for each question. 
Input validation is present to prevent users from proceeding unless valid input (A, B or C) is entered
If the player's guess is incorrect, the correct answer will be revealed
Player Input is also case insensitive, thanks to the .upper() method
User scores are added up at the end of the quiz, and the player is given a % score at the end
Answers to the questions will also be revealed at the end
